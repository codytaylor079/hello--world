# hello--world

Hello there!

My name is Cody, I collect comic books and really like superheroes in general. 
I love to skateboard, by myself or with my friends. I like to use Unity to mess
around and make video games. I also make music using FL Studio, and sell my music
to small time rappers, singers, and other artists.
